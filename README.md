## About Me
Hey there! I'm Vishnu Jangid, a graduate from IIIT Una with a passion for all things tech. I've got my hands dirty with React.js, Node.js, and Blockchain, and during my internship, I worked a cool team in building a decentralized app.
But it's not all serious stuffâ€”I love a good challenge, which is probably why I've tackled creating an YouTube-clone and a crowdfunding Dapp. Beyond coding, you'll find me actively participating in programming competitions and being part of the awesome coding community at FORCE.
I'm all about problem-solving, a tech enthusiast at heart, and ready to dive into any project with a collaborative spirit. Let's make some cool things happen! ðŸš€.
